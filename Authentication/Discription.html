    <h1>Hi, <br>
        This is Mudasir Nadeem
    </h1>
    <p>I am a web frontend developer. I have learned HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, as well as JavaScript concepts such as loops, objects, OOP concepts, junctions, and frameworks like Angular and Blazor. For Angular, I have used the PrimeNG library, and for Blazor, I have used MudBlazor, Radzen, Blazor Syncfusion, and DevExpress.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML
            <ul>
                <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is used for web structure.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Css
            <ul>
                <li>   <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a styling language used to control the presentation of HTML documents. It allows web developers to apply styles like colors, fonts, spacing, and layout to enhance the visual appearance of web pages.</p></li>
            </ul>

        <li>
            Bootstrap 
            <ul>
                <li>
                 <p>Bootstrap is a powerful front-end framework that simplifies web development by providing a set of pre-designed components and styles. Developed by Twitter, Bootstrap allows developers to create responsive and visually appealing websites with ease. It includes a grid system, reusable UI components, and built-in JavaScript functionalities, making it a popular choice for building modern, mobile-friendly web applications.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li> JavaScript
            <ul>
                    <li>JavaScript is a versatile programming language commonly used for building dynamic and interactive web applications. As a client-side scripting language, it runs in the user's browser, allowing developers to manipulate the content and behavior of web pages. JavaScript is essential for implementing features like user interactivity, form validation, and asynchronous communication with servers. With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript can also be used on the server side, enabling full-stack development.</li>

                Angular
              <ul>
                <li>Angular is a powerful front-end framework developed by Google for building dynamic and robust web applications. It is based on TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, and follows a component-based architecture. Angular provides a comprehensive set of tools, including data binding, dependency injection, and a modular structure, making it well-suited for creating scalable and maintainable single-page applications (SPAs). Developers use Angular to enhance the user experience with features like two-way data binding, routing, and a rich ecosystem of libraries and modules.</li>

                blazer 
                <ul>
                <li>Blazor is a modern web framework developed by Microsoft that allows developers to build interactive and dynamic web applications using C# and .NET. Blazor enables the development of single-page applications (SPAs) with code sharing between the client and server, reducing the need for JavaScript. It follows a component-based architecture, similar to other front-end frameworks, and supports features like data binding, routing, and dependency injection. Blazor is available in two flavors: Blazor WebAssembly, which runs on the client side, and Blazor Server, which runs on the server with real-time communication to the client. It provides a seamless integration of .NET capabilities for building robust and maintainable web applications.</li>
